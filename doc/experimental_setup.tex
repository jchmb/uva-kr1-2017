\section{Experimental Setup}
% how do we measure complexity
% what software do we use, completely describe all the tools and procedures
% maybe insert figure from Finns paper

\subsection{Dataset}
% exlain we needed to write our own algorithm to generate 3d sudoku's of different sizes


% tabel with all avg/stddev 
% heatmap
% some plots

\section{Definitions}

A 3D Sudoku is a Sudoku of size $N \times N \times N$. It consists of rows, columns, and layers, which are sequences of cells spanning across a single dimension. Similar to the 2D Sudoku, each row, column, and layer must contain every number $d \in \{1, \hdots, N\}$ exactly once. In contrast to 2D Sudokus, the constraint that every number must also appear exactly once in each block is dropped for the 3D Sudoku.

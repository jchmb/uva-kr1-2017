\section{Hypothesis}

The hypothesis of this paper can be formulated as follows. Given is a 3D Sudoku of size $N$ with $M$ filled cells. As $N$ grows, the complexity (i.e., the CPU time, restarts, decisions and conflicts) grows and the ratio of $\frac{M}{N}$ must increase in order for the 3D Sudoku to be satisfiable in reasonable time.
